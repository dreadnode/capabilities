## Abuse Info

No abuse is necessary. This edge only indicates that the principal has been granted a particular Entra ID role.

## Opsec Considerations

The opsec considerations for a particular action authorized by a principal&ldquo;s active Entra ID role assignment will wholly depend on what the action taken is. This edge does not capture all abusable possibilities.
