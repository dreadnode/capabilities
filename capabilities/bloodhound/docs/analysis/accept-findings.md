title: Accept Attack Path Findings

Purpose
=======

This article outlines how to accept a principal in an attack path finding so it is hidden in the principal table of the finding. It should be used by BHE users whenever a risk has been decided to be accepted or [while waiting for a change to leave its retention period](/collect-data/enterprise-collection/data-retention).

Prerequisites
=============

* Logged in as a user role that is authorized to accept attack path impacted principals, see [Administering users and roles](/manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles).

Process
=======

Accept a principal finding
--------------------------

1.  Navigate to the Attack Paths page.
2.  Expand the attack path finding and click the menu to the left of the principal's name (three vertical dots), then click \`Accept\`.

3.  In the pop-up window \`Accept Attack Path\`, set the number of days the finding's principal should be accepted and click the button \`Accept\`.
    * If accepting permanently: set the duration for a long duration.
    * If accepting while waiting for a change to leave its retention period: set the duration depending on the retention scenario. For example, when accepting a principal from \`Logons from Tier Zero Users\`, the duration should be 7 days. See [Data reconciliation and retention in BloodHound Enterprise](/collect-data/enterprise-collection/data-retention).

Outcome
=======

When a principal is accepted, it is hidden from the principal table in the attack path until you toggle the setting \`Accepted\`. The principal and its edges will still be visible in the Explore and Posture pages.
