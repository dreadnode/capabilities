The ClaimSpecialIdentity edge represents the ability to obtain an access token containing a special identity (group) SID. Unlike regular groups, membership in special identities is determined at authentication rather than by an explicit member list.
See the Abuse section for specific cases.

## Abuse Info

**Guest Account (RID -501)**
* The Guest user account allows users without a personal account to log in. The account has no password by default.
* If enabled, anyone with AD access can log in with the Guest account.

**Network Identity (S-1-5-2)**
* Any user or computer accessing a Windows system via a network has the Network identity in their access token.

**Authentication Authority Asserted Identity (S-1-18-1)**
* Included in access tokens when an account is authenticated directly against a domain controller and not through Kerberos constrained delegation (service asserted identity).

**Key Trust (S-1-18-4)**
* Included in access tokens when authentication is based on public key credentials via key trust objects.
* Anyone with key trust credentials (e.g., from a Shadow Credentials attack) can obtain Key Trust identity access through PKINIT authentication.

**MFA Key Property (S-1-18-5)**
* Similar to Key Trust but requires the MFA property on the key trust credentials.
* A Shadow Credentials attack enables anyone to obtain the MFA Key Property identity access through PKINIT authentication.

**NTLM Authentication (S-1-64-10)**
* Included in an access token when authentication occurs via NTLM protocol.
* Any AD account can obtain NTLM authentication identity access, assuming NTLM is available.

**Schannel Authentication (S-1-64-14)**
* Included in an access token when authentication occurs via Schannel protocol.
* Any AD account can obtain the Schannel Authentication identity, for example by performing certificate authentication over Schannel.

**This Organization Identity (S-1-5-15)**
* Assigned to all accounts within the same Active Directory forest and trusted forests without selective authentication.

**This Organization Certificate Identity (S-1-5-65-1)**
* Assigned to all accounts within the same Active Directory forest and trusted forests without selective authentication, when the Kerberos PAC contains an NTLM_SUPPLEMENTAL_CREDENTIAL structure.
* Authentication using an ADCS certificate ensures the required PAC structure.
