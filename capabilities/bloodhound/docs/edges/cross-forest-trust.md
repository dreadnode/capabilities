title: CrossForestTrust
description: The CrossForestTrust edge represents a trust relationship between two domains/forests. In this relationship, the source node domain has a cross-forest (interforest) trust to the destination node domain, allowing principals (users and computers) from the destination domain to access resources in the source domain.

## Abuse Info

The cross-forest trust does not enable a compromise of any of the domains by default.

BloodHound creates separate traversable edges between the domains if the configuration of the trust enables abuse.

## Opsec Considerations

There is no OPSEC associated with this edge.

## Edge Schema

Source: [Domain](/resources/nodes/domain)  
Destination: [Domain](/resources/nodes/domain)   
Traversable: **Yes**
