title: WriteOwnerLimitedRights
description: "When specific privileges on an object's DACL are explicitly granted to the `OWNER RIGHTS` SID (S-1-3-4), and inheritance is configured for those permissions, they are inherited by the new object owner after a change in ownership. In this case, implicit owner rights are blocked, and the new owner is granted only the specific inherited privileges granted to `OWNER RIGHTS`."
