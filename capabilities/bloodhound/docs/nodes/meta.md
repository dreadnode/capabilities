## Representation

Meta nodes represent a set of related nodes. They are created and used by analysis in order to support attack path mapping for different zones and environments. These nodes do not directly represent any actual entity from collected environments. As their name suggests, Meta nodes hold metadata for attributing and rendering attack path details for their associated zone and environment.

## Node properties

The node supports the properties of the table. Two types of property names will be used, depending on where the property is found:

- **Entity Panel:** Name shown in the BloodHound UI.
- **Database:** Name stored in the BloodHound database and returned by the BloodHound API. This is to be used when running Cypher queries.

|                         |                 |                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity Panel**        | **Database**    | **Description**                                                                                |
| Last Seen by BloodHound | lastseen        | The most recent time the object or a reference to it was collected and ingested in BloodHound. |
| Owner Object Id         | owner_objectid  | The object ID for the environment the Meta node is associated with                             |
| Principal Count         | principal_count | The number of principals in the set the Meta node represents                                   |
| Date                    | date            | ISO time string when the node was created                                                      |
| Composite \*            | composite\_\*   | Count properties for the associated \* value (node type) that are represented by the Meta node |

## Edges

Any [traversable](/resources/edges/traversable-edges#traversable-edges) edge type may be linked to/from this node.
